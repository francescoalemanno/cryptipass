# CryptiPass

CryptiPass is a Go library for generating high-entropy, pronounceable passphrases. It offers a secure and simple way to create human-friendly, memorable passphrases that are still cryptographically strong. Each passphrase is composed of a sequence of randomly generated words, ensuring both security and usability.
We also have a [CLI](cmd/genpw) available for non-library uses.
## Features

- **High Entropy**: CryptiPass ensures that generated passphrases exceed 20.25 bits of entropy per word, providing strong security against brute-force attacks.
- **Pronounceable Words**: Unlike many other random passphrase generators, CryptiPass generates words that are pronounceable, making them easier to remember and use.
- **Customizable Length**: You can specify the number of words in each passphrase, making the length customizable based on your security needs.

## Installation

To install CryptiPass, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass
```

## Usage

The library exposes two main functions for passphrase generation:

### 1. `NewPassphrase(words uint64) string`

This function generates a passphrase with a specified number of randomly generated, pronounceable words. The words are separated by periods (`.`) for clarity and convenience.

#### Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass"
)

func main() {
    passphrase := cryptipass.NewPassphrase(4)
    fmt.Println("Your passphrase:", passphrase)
}
```

In this example, a passphrase with 4 words is generated, and the output might look like:

```
Your passphrase: vogo.sini.cima.hupdi
```

### 2. `GenMixWord() string`

This function generates a single high-entropy word using a mixture of syllable lengths, ensuring that each word is pronounceable while maintaining strong randomness.

#### Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass"
)

func main() {
    word := cryptipass.GenMixWord()
    fmt.Println("Generated word:", word)
}
```

This will output a randomly generated, pronounceable word such as:

```
Generated word: lupteki
```

## How It Works

1. **Passphrase Generation** (`NewPassphrase`):
   - The function `NewPassphrase` generates a passphrase consisting of a specified number of words. It calls `GenMixWord` repeatedly to create each word and concatenates them with periods (`.`).

2. **Word Generation** (`GenMixWord`):
   - `GenMixWord` uses an entropy-certified word length distribution and creates words by selecting random starting syllables and building on them until a valid word is formed.
   - This ensures that each generated word has more than 20.25 bits of entropy, providing strong security guarantees.

3. **Pronounceability** (`GenWord`):
   - The function `GenWord` ensures that the words are pronounceable by constructing them from a set of predefined syllables, avoiding consonant clusters or vowel sequences that would be difficult to pronounce.

## Entropy and Security

Each word generated by CryptiPass contains more than 20.25 bits of entropy, which means that a 4-word passphrase would have approximately 81 bits of entropy. This level of entropy makes the passphrase highly resistant to brute-force attacks, providing security even against well-resourced attackers.

The entropy is certified based on the mixture of word lengths and the randomness of syllable generation, ensuring both unpredictability and usability.
