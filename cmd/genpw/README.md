# genpw - CryptiPass CLI

`genpw` is a simple command-line interface (CLI) for generating high-entropy, pronounceable passphrases using the CryptiPass library. It allows users to specify the number of words in each passphrase and the number of passphrases to generate, making it easy to quickly create secure, human-friendly passwords directly from the terminal.

This tool is part of the [CryptiPass](https://github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass) project and resides in the `cmd/genpw` subdirectory.

## Features

- **Generate Secure Passphrases**: Easily generate high-entropy, pronounceable passphrases with customizable length.
- **Customizable Output**: Control the number of words per passphrase and how many passphrases you want to generate.
- **Lightweight and Easy to Use**: Simple CLI flags for ease of use and quick password generation.

## Installation

To install the `genpw` CLI, first ensure you have Go installed. Then run:

```bash
go install github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass/cmd/genpw@latest
```

This will install the `genpw` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage

Once installed, you can generate passphrases by running `genpw` with the following options:

```
  -c    run entropy certification algorithm
        users not necessarily need to concern with this detail.
  -cd uint
        certification effort.
        A larger number leads to more accurate results
        at the expense of exponentially longer completion times. (default 1)
  -n uint
        number of passwords to generate (default 6)
  -p string
        pattern used to generate passphrase e.g. try:
        -p WWW20dd
    
        other possible patterns are formed by combining:
        - 'W' for uppercase word.
        - 'w' lowercase word.
        - 's' symbol.
        - 'd' digit.
         (default "W.w.w")
```

### Example Commands

1. **Generate 6 passphrases with 3 words each** (default):

```bash
genpw
```

This will output something like:

```
Passphrase                    Log10(Guesses)    EntropyLog2

Joilionel.scric.glicam        20.70              69.76
Haneatri.unfolop.freskl       21.17              71.33
Ricie.enrelerc.morsman        21.90              73.74
Snuterov.possarb.sprive       22.93              77.18
Hartiner.acycata.ovalnegis    23.35              78.57
Grantdoti.irthed.imeatill     23.61              79.45
```

1. **Generate passphrases with custom pattern**:

```bash
genpw -p "WW20dds" -n 5
```

The output might look like:

```go
Passphrase                Log10(Guesses)    EntropyLog2

DofyonLivord2012@         15.26              51.70
DinkedMankess2026^        16.09              54.43
BlyestaHameloty2062=      18.02              60.87
ShantlyzSectoo2098=       18.15              61.29
AxoncingTwovernis2056*    19.12              64.52
```

or

```bash
genpw -p "w.w.w.w" -n 5
```

The output might look like:

```go
Passphrase                              Log10(Guesses)    EntropyLog2

unctirter.arbeday.amersdowf.ovyarvis    33.60              112.62
```

### Entropy Considerations

Each password generated by CryptiPass comes with an exact entropy evaluation . For example:
- A 4-word passphrase has roughly 97 bits of entropy.
- A 6-word passphrase has approximately 146 bits of entropy.

This allows for highly secure passphrases, even against brute-force attacks.

## Certification (Debug/Development Mode)

For debugging or testing purposes, the `certify` function can be used to track the entropy of generated passwords over large runs.
