# genpw - CryptiPass CLI

`genpw` is a simple command-line interface (CLI) for generating high-entropy, pronounceable passphrases using the CryptiPass library. It allows users to specify the number of words in each passphrase and the number of passphrases to generate, making it easy to quickly create secure, human-friendly passwords directly from the terminal.

This tool is part of the [CryptiPass](https://github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass) project and resides in the `cmd/genpw` subdirectory.

## Features

- **Generate Secure Passphrases**: Easily generate high-entropy, pronounceable passphrases with customizable length.
- **Customizable Output**: Control the number of words per passphrase and how many passphrases you want to generate.
- **Lightweight and Easy to Use**: Simple CLI flags for ease of use and quick password generation.

## Installation

To install the `genpw` CLI, first ensure you have Go installed. Then run:

```bash
go install github.com/francescoalemanno/cryptipass/cmd/genpw@latest
```

This will install the `genpw` binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

## Usage

Once installed, you can generate passphrases by running `genpw` with the following options:

```
Usage: genpw [flags]

Flags:
  -w uint
        Number of words per passphrase (default: 4)
  -p uint
        Number of passphrases to generate (default: 4)
```

### Example Commands

1. **Generate 4 passphrases with 4 words each** (default):

```bash
genpw
```

This will output something like:

```
vogo.sini.cima.hupdi
tobo.vaki.junpu.marlo
hakra.dusi.jokle.binti
ruglo.temdi.silu.durpo
```

2. **Generate 2 passphrases with 6 words each**:

```bash
genpw -w 6 -p 2
```

The output might look like:

```
verlo.bagti.firno.mirki.salma.dorti
nikto.jogna.wakti.derlo.kina.mokli
```

### Entropy Considerations

Each word generated by CryptiPass has over 20.25 bits of entropy. For example:
- A 4-word passphrase has roughly 81 bits of entropy.
- A 6-word passphrase has approximately 121.5 bits of entropy.

This makes the passphrases highly secure, even against brute-force attacks.

## Certification (Debug/Development Mode)

For debugging or testing purposes, the `certify` function can be used to track the entropy of generated words over large runs. This function prints out the number of unique words and the entropy estimate after every 10,000 words generated.

To run this manually, modify the `main.go` file and call `certify()` in your Go environment.
